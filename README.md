# chaotic-moving-circles
Chaotic Moving Circles is the first project in a series where I (hopefully) will visualize different mathematical formulas. This project is kind of a case study to try the basic setup of writing code, recording it, etc. There is no deeper meaning behind this project. Other than that I really like the visual impression Chaotic Moving Circles.

## Compilation
The presentation is programmed in C++. The build tool is bazel and GNU Make. As a graphics library I used [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). The required packages are thus
```
gcc
bazel
libsfml-dev (depends on your OS though)
```
If you have all three packages installed you can simply type in the project root:
```
make
```
This command will build and start Chaotic Moving Circles in fullscreen. Have fun and enjoy :)
